👋 Hi, I’m [@someq](https://github.com/someq). My real name is Farid, I am a *whatever* developer from [Kyrgyztan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan) (country of clean water and huge mountains, visit us some time!).
*Whatever* means I can write anything in any language, but prefer:
 * Python,
 * JavaScript,
 * React.

🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter and writing an app with it.

💞️ Not looking for collaboration right now.

📫 You may find me in russian social network [VKontakte](https://vk.com/ita_hzom) and in [Telegram](https://t.me/Hzom1).
